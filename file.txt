<b>16:36 Local Time, 15:36 GMT, 21:06 IST:</b> <b>It has been called off.</b> Only 15.2 overs were possible. Sussex started off really well as Luke Wright and Philip Salt batted positively. But timely wickets derailed the innings and Sussex were placed precariously when the heavens opened up. AND that was it! The rains had the last laugh or should I say they laughed all the way till the game got called off. Cricket continues though and we will continue getting you all the coverage, Buh bye for now.

<b>14:59 Local Time, 13:59 GMT, 19:29 IST:</b> The heavens have opened up and the players run to seek shelter. Let's hope that it's only a passing shower. The openers got Sussex off to an excellent start, but the Surrey bowlers have fought back well. The spinners choked the flow of runs with regular wickets. We'll keep you updated...
